1. What is code rot, and why does it happen?

Code rot is code that cannot be extended to work with other pieces of code
without changing the original piece of code. It happens if code is very tightly
coupled with it's dependencies, when it shouldn't be.

2. What is the design of a software product?

The design of a software product is the source code because the source code is
what the compiler uses to build the final executable.

3. According to Uncle Bob, what is the essential characteristic of
   Object-Oriented design?

The essential characteristic of OO is dependency inversion, which means that
the control code doesn't depend on the inputs and outputs directly but instead
uses an abstraction, so the inputs and outputs can be changed without changing
the control code.
